# Service Oriented in Python
In this repository we explore the service-oriented programming using python. I tried to
implement it in a way that the services can be added/removed on the fly using the services_config.yml

## How to run?
Run the server:
```
python xmlrpc_server.py
```

Run the client:
```
python xmlrpc_client.py
```
